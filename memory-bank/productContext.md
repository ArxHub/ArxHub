# Product Context

This document describes the "why" behind the project, focusing on the problems it solves, how it should work from a user perspective, and the overall user experience goals.

## Problem Statement

Existing knowledge management tools are often rigid, siloed, or lack sufficient extensibility. Users need a flexible platform to connect ideas, manage diverse information types, and customize their workflow.

## How it Works (User Perspective)

Users can create notes using Markdown or a rich text editor. They can link notes together using `[[wikilink]]` syntax. The application visualizes these connections in a graph view. Users can install plugins to add new features, integrate with other services, or customize the interface.

## User Experience Goals

- Provide a seamless and intuitive note-taking experience.
- Ensure fast and reliable access to information.
- Empower users to customize the application to their needs.

## User Stories (Optional)

- As a student, I want to link my class notes and research papers so I can easily see the relationships between topics.
- As a writer, I want to use Markdown for drafting and easily embed images and links to sources.
- As a developer, I want to install plugins to integrate with my code editor and version control system.
