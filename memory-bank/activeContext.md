# Active Context

This document tracks the current focus of work, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, important patterns, and project insights.

## Current Work Focus

Populating the core memory bank files with initial project context based on the concept of a knowledge management system.

## Recent Changes

Updated `projectbrief.md` with project name, goals, and core requirements.
Updated `productContext.md` with problem statement, user perspective, UX goals, and user stories.

## Next Steps

Continue populating the remaining core memory bank files:
- `systemPatterns.md`
- `techContext.md`
- `progress.md`

## Active Decisions and Considerations

Ensuring the memory bank content accurately reflects the characteristics of a flexible and extensible knowledge management system.
Considering how to best document the plugin architecture and data storage solution in `systemPatterns.md`.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

Using Markdown for documentation.
Focusing on a modular and extensible design.

## Learnings and Project Insights

The memory bank structure provides a clear framework for documenting project context.
Populating these files early helps establish a shared understanding of the project vision.
