# Progress

This document tracks the project's progress, including what is working, what is left to build, the current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works

- The basic memory bank structure is in place.
- Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created.

## What's Left to Build

- Implement the core application logic (file handling, indexing, search).
- Develop the user interface components.
- Build the plugin system.
- Implement note linking and graph visualization.
- Add support for various content formats.
- Develop potential backend features for sync/collaboration.
- Write tests for all components and features.
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline.

## Current Status

The project is in the initial documentation and setup phase. The foundational memory bank files have been populated with the project vision and technical context. Development of the core application has not yet started.

## Known Issues

None at this very early stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

The initial decision to use a file-based storage system for notes is a core tenet, influenced by applications like Obsidian and TiddlyWiki for portability and user control over data.
